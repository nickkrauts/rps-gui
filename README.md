Rock, paper, scissors project for The Odin Project

The goal of the project is to integrate my learning thus far
in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an in-browser rock, paper, scissors game.

In particular, I will practice functions and linking HTML/CSS/JavaScript together
to make a clean, user-friendly game playable in the browser.
